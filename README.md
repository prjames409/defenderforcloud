# Defender for Cloud
Welcome to our Pandas-based Automation Project! This code utilizes the particular libraries to simplify your analysist life. In this code, we allow the user to upload a .csv file  of Azure Defender Security Recommendations.

Key Points: The downloaded Azure recommomendations csv file will need to be in the same folder as the this script. 

Once the file is uploaded, the script will drop certain columns, filter the column 'state' for 'Unhealthy', generate today's date, and export the csv to excel document. THis script will save you at least five minutes in normalizing the your Azure recommmendations output. 

Please let me know your thoughts. 


Steps:
Create folder to house script.
Change directory to folder where you will store script. 
Clone repo locally within the file location. 
Export Azure securiry recommendations. 
Save the Azure security recommendation csv to the same file location as script. 
Run script
select the downloaded file. 
THe export will be in the same file location with current date.
